<h1>Known problems in the current release of the STIR software</h1>

<ul>
<li>Currently the implementation if the incremental interpolating
backprojector can have problems on certain processors due to floating point
rounding errors. You would notice problems in the central voxel, which
will influence neighboring voxels in the iterative algorithms. 
Running the recon_test_pack will tell you if you have the problem (but
there might still be a problem for your particular scanner/pixel size).

<strong>Update</strong> Thanks to an update by Bing Bai, this seems less of 
an issue now. Please notify the mailing list if this problem still occurs
on your system (give details of OS, processor, compiler and compiler switches).

See the User's Guide for details on how to choose another backprojector.
</li>
<li>Currently the implementation if the incremental interpolating
backprojector fails when the number of views is not even. Images
are wrong, even though the programs might run till the end.
</li>
<li>Images have to have the default number of planes. Trying to 
forward project images with smaller or larger number of planes
will show up some problems, which we thought to have removed already :-/ .
</li>
<li>  CPU times reported are invalid on Windows 9?, maybe ME as well. They are
fine on NT and later.There doesn't seem to be a way to get 
CPU times in the older Windows versions. 
</li>
</ul>
