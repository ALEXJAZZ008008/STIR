<h1>Known problems in the current release of the STIR software</h1>

<ul>
<li>Currently the implementation if the incremental interpolating
backprojector has problems on certain processors due to floating point
rounding errors. Intel *86 and PowerPC give correct results, SunSparc and Opteron
has a problem at tangential_pos_num==0 (also HP Risc stations give
problems). (You would notice problems in the central voxel, which
will influence neighboring voxels in the iterative algorithms.) 

See the User's Guide for details on how to choose another backprojector.
</li>
<li>Currently the implementation if the incremental interpolating
backprojector fails when the number of views in not even. Images
are wrong, even though the programs might run till the end.
</li>
<li>Images have to have the default number of planes. Trying to 
forward project images with smaller or larger number of planes
will show up some problems, which we thought to have removed already :-/ .
</li>
<li>When specifying shapes (e.g. for generate_image or list_ROI_values),
the code to specify Euler angles is buggy
(get after set is not consistent).
Also, the direction vectors are ignored during parsing.
</li>
<li>OSMAPOSL by default uses a truncation to a cylindrical FOV. 
However, for even-sized images, this FOV is half a pixel 
displaced w.r.t. to the origin used in the rest of STIR.
The same routine is used in manip_image and compare_image.
</li>
<li>  CPU times reported are invalid on Windows 9?, maybe ME as well. They are
fine on NT and presumably 2000 and XP. There doesn't seem to be a way to get 
CPU times in the older Windows versions. 
</li>
</ul>
