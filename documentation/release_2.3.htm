    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 2.3 (dated ?? 2012)</h1>

<p>This update was prepared by Kris Thielemans (Algorithms and Software Consulting Ltd).

<ul>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>
<!---
<h3>Important bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The routines to handle SimSET data did not really work in previous releases,
but should work now. This is all still preliminary. Check SimSET/README.txt for
some information.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>build system</h3>
<ul>
<li> 
Using <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> is now recommended. Some options
such as shared libraries and SWIG support can only be enabled when using CMake.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>This release is known to fail when both MPI and shared libraries are enabled. You will see linking errors in all non_MPI executables.</li>
<li>The recon_test_pack routines fail with the MPI version. See the mailing list for a work-around.</li>
<li>ECAT6 routines seem to have problems since STIR 2.0. ECAT6 is therefore no longer supported</li>
<li>The interpolating back-projector can still give problems in the centre of the images
on some architectures/compiler/optimisation settings. We recommend to use the ray-tracing
matrix (with additional rays) instead.</li>
<li>When using Visual Studio (Express) with the provided solution files, there is a linking problem for some
utilities. It is recommended to use the new <tt>CMake</tt> files for building instead.</li>
<li>When using <code>GRAPHICS=X</code> (i.e. on Unix/Linux/MacOSX) the window displaying
the bitmaps is sometimes empty. This might depend on your X server settings.
This affects <tt>manip_image</tt>, <tt>manip_projdata</tt> and <tt>display_projdata</tt>. 
We have currently no work-around (aside from using <code>GRAPHICS=PGM</code> or
<tt>stir_write_pgm</tt>).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Addition of the FORE algorithm.</li>
<li>Preliminary (but functional) interface for using STIR from Python.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minor bug fixes</h3>

<h3>Documentation changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Wiki expands more and more, so use it in addition to the provided PDFs.
</li>
 </ul>

<h3>recon_test_pack changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>minor changes to some scripts</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Other changes to tests</h3>
<p>None</p>

<H2>What's new for developers (aside from what should be obvious
from the above):</H2>

<h3>Major bugs fixed</h3>
<p>None</p>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>BasicCoordinate, VectorWithOffset and Array now have new members at() (checking for out-of-range index access) and empty() (like std::vector).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other code changes</h3>
<ul>
<li> A few minor changes for SWIG compatibility</li>
</ul>
