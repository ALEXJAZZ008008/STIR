<p>Nearly all work on this update was by Kris Thielemans. <br>
Thanks to Oliver Nix for fixes for (and testing with) Visual Studio Express 2005.
<br>
Also many thanks to M&eacute;rence Sibomana for updating the LLN ecat matrix library to
iron out some problems with STIR.

<h2> Summary for endusers (also to be read by developers)</h2>

<h3>New utilities</h3>
<ul>
</ul>


<h3>Bugs removed that affect users</h3>
<ul>
<li> corrected bug in CListModeData::save_get_position/set_get_position occured 
in the last chunk of the listmode file (where chunk size was determined by 
buf_size_in_bytes = 8683520). In that case, the repositioning failed and called
error() and aborted the program. In normal use, this bug would
normally only have appeared if the last frame was very short.
