    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 3.0 (dated ??/11/2013)</h1>

<p>This release is the first to handle SPECT data properly.
It contains code by Carl&eacute;s Falc&oacute;n (Biomedical Image Group (GIB), Universitat de Barcelona)
to create the system matrix for SPECT, integrated into STIR by Bert&aacute; Mart&iacute; Fuster 
(Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia) and Kris Thielemans 
(University College London, Algorithms and Software Consulting Ltd), together with some
additions and minor bug fixes by the same authors.
Additional testing by Charalampos Tsoumpas (KCL).</p>
<p>This work was the result of a collaboration between University of Barcelona,
King's College London and University College London, and is reported in<br />
  Berta Marti Fuster, Carles Falcon, Charalampos Tsoumpas, Lefteris Livieratos, Pablo Aguiar, Albert Cot, Domenec Ros and Kris Thielemans,<br />
  <i>Integration of advanced 3D SPECT modeling into the open-source STIR framework</i>,<br />
  Med. Phys. 40, 092502 (2013); 
  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.4816676">DOI 10.1118/1.4816676</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition, changes to the IO code (currently enabled for projection data only) mean that
more information such as modality, patient position and timing is available and kept (update by Kris Thielemans, UCL).

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>
<h3>Important bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>None
</li>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li> new projection matrix for SPECT (called <code>SPECT UB</code>) supporting parallel hole collimators 
with non-circular orbits, including attenuation modelling and 3D PSF</li>
<li>modifications to <code>ProjMatrixByBin</code> to allow larger matrices (currently needing uint64 support by the compiler) and clearing the cache</li>
<li>Interfile 3.3 IO for SPECT projection data.</li>
<li> reading and writing of images via <a href="http://www.itk.org">ITK</a>. As ITK has its own registry of 
file formats, this extends STIR to support Nifti (.nii), MetaIO (.mhdr), NRRD (.nhdr)  etc. 
To enable this, you need to have ITK installed when building STIR with CMake. 
To write images in any of these file formats, you need
to set an explict file format type and set it to <tt>ITK</tt> .<br />
<strong>Warning:</strong> The translation of the geometry between STIR and ITK
is currently incomplete as STIR <strong>ignores patient orientation</strong> for images. 
</li>
<li>The <tt>list_projdata_info</tt> utilities has an extra option <tt>--exam</tt> to
list some exam information (patient position and timing).
</li>
<li>The distribution now includes sample scripts  (in the <tt>samples</tt> folder) 
for simulating PET data, adding Poisson noise
and reconstructing the data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interfile reading/writing has changed to accomodate SPECT. </li>
<li>Projection data IO (both static and dynamic) now keeps more information such as modality, patient position and timing. This should mean for instance that convertions between different file
formats (e.g. conv_to_ecat7, stir_math -s) preserve more information.
</li>
<li>Interfile reading now exits with an error if a vectored key (such as <tt>matrix size</tt>)
is used before its size is given with the appropriate keyword (such as <tt>number of dimensions</tt>). In prior versions of STIR, a warning was issued, but a crash could happen afterwards.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system</h3>
<ul>
<li> 
Using <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> is now recommended (see the wiki). Some options
such as shared libraries and SWIG support can only be enabled when using CMake. Hand-crafted project files
for Visual Studio are no longer distributed. Hand-crafted Unix Makefiles are still there but 
getting out-of date (no ITK for instance).
</li>
<li>compilation when using CMake is speeded-up a bit as dependencies of the tests on STIR libraries are reduced.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, using shared libraries fails. We need to sort out dependencies between libraries to fix this.</li>
<li>This release is known to fail when both MPI and shared libraries are enabled. You will see linking errors in all non_MPI executables.</li>
<li>The recon_test_pack routines fail with the MPI version. A work-around is to prefix the reconstruction executables with <tt>mpirun -np 4</tt> or so.</li>
<li>The MPI version of OSMAPOSL and OSSPS cannot compute the value of the objective function. Therefore, setting the
<tt>report objective function values interval</tt> keyword to 1 will cause a crash.</li>
<li>ECAT6 is no longer supported</li>
<li>The interpolating back-projector still gives problems in the centre of the images
on some architectures/compiler/optimisation settings. We recommend to use the ray-tracing
matrix (with additional rays) instead.</li>
<li>When using <code>GRAPHICS=X</code> (i.e. on Unix/Linux/MacOSX) the window displaying
the bitmaps is sometimes empty. This might depend on your X server settings.
This affects <tt>manip_image</tt>, <tt>manip_projdata</tt> and <tt>display_projdata</tt>. 
We have currently no work-around (aside from using <code>GRAPHICS=PGM</code> or
<tt>stir_write_pgm</tt>).
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minor bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>small changes to allow compilation with the CLang compiler version 5.0.</li>
<li>removed an error when writing a usage message when converting SimSET projection data.</li>
<li>when ECAT6 image IO is enabled, now first check if it's an ECAT6 file (this avoids strange
crashes when the file turns out not be ECAT6 after all).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added documentation on new features</li> 
<li>Added documentation on the <code>Interpolation</code> matrix. Somehow
we had forgotten to include that before.</li>
<li>Added more examples of shapes to <tt>samples/generate_image.par</tt>. Also corrected doxygen of
<code>EllipsoidalCylinder</code> for initial/final angle parameters.</li>
<li>The Wiki expands more and more, so use it in addition to the provided PDFs.
</li>
 </ul>

<h3>recon_test_pack changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>updated version number and added some clarification to the README.txt</li>
<li>added a test script for the motion version</li>
TODO SPECT
 </ul>

<h3>Other changes to tests</h3>
<ul>
<li>added tests for the ITK IO routines</li>
</ul>

<H2>What's new for developers (aside from what should be obvious
from the above):</H2>

<h3>Major bugs fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>none</li>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>SPECT matrix modelling etc (see above)</li>
<li>expanded the class <code>PatientPosition</code> to allow left/right positioning, 
unknown positioning, and using DICOM-style abbreviations such as <tt>HFS</tt>.<br />
<strong>WARNING:</strong>The default constructor used to set the position to HFS
but now sets it to unknown.
</li>
<li>new classes <code>ImagingModality</code> and <code>ExamInfo</code>. The latter
contains the modality, <code>PatientPosition</code> and <code>TimeFrameDefinitions</code>.
</li>
<li>projection data (<code>ProjData</code>, <code>DynamicProjData</code> etc) and
list mode data (<code>CListModeData</code>)
now have an <code>ExamInfo</code> member such that time frames etc can be passed along.
Their constructors have been modified accordingly.
</li>
<li>changes to <code>ProjDatainfoCylindrical</code> to allow different radii for different views</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other code changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>removed a few instances of <code>using std::string</code> etc from the include files
to avoid conflicts with global or non-std classes. This might mean you need to put these
statements in your .cxx files (or add <code>std::</code> in various places of course).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system</h3>
<ul>
<li> We no longer add the STIR_LOCAL subdirectory in the main CMakeLists.txt
(if STIR_LOCAL is enabled). 
We now  leave that to STIR_LOCAL/stir_extra_dirs.cmake. This effectively means
that if you extended STIR by having a CMakeLists.txt in your local directory,
it will no longer be picked-up and you will have to edit your local 
stir_extra_dirs.cmake with something like
<code>
 add_subdirectory(${STIR_LOCAL})
</code>
</li>
</ul>
