    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 2.1 alpha (dated October 2009)</h1>

<p>Most of the work in this update was by Kris Thielemans (Hammersmith Imanet Ltd)
and Charalampos Tsoumpas (Imperial College and Hammersmith Imanet Ltd).
Some older code by Sanida Mustafovic (Imperial College and Hammersmith Imanet Ltd) 
has now finally been incorporated into STIR as well.
Other contributions are mentioned explicitly below.<br />
See also the new <tt>contrib</tt> sub-directory available in the documentation zip file.

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>

<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>ECAT6 routines seem to have problems since STIR 2.0</li>
<li>Some new utilities might not compile under windows with Visual Studio
as this doesn't have the <code>getopt</code> function.</li>
<li>Visual Studio 2008 has a linking problem related to the new Input file IO factories.</li>
<li>The interpolating back-projector can still give problems in the centre of the images
on some architectures/compiler/optimisation settings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New utilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><tt>abs_image</tt>, <tt>convert_to_binary_image.cxx</tt>, <tt>find_fwhm_in_image</tt></li>
<li>Utilities in <tt>modelling_utilities</tt>.
<li>Parametric image reconstruction algorithms <tt>POSMAPOSL</tt> and <tt>POSSPS</tt>. 
Currently we have only an objective function for Patlak, but extension
to other linear models is easy.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New functionality of existing utilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added data for the <strong>GE Discovery 600</strong>.</li>
<li><tt>stir_math</tt> has 2 new options <tt>--parametric</tt> or <tt>--dynamic</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>updated doxygen</li>
 </ul>

<h3>recon_test_pack changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moved the tests for the ecat routines to a separate file <tt>run_ecat_tests.sh</tt><li>
<li>Updated Windows batch files. They were broken in STIR 2.0</li>
</ul>

<H2>What's new for developers (aside from what should be obvious
from the above):</H2>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ArrayFilter2DUsingConvolution</code> and <code>ArrayFilter3DUsingConvolution</code>.</li>
<li>Preliminary classes for dynamic and gated data</li>
<li>New member <code>fill_nonidentifiable_target_parameters</code> of the 
<code>GeneralisedObjectiveFunction</code> hierarchy. This used by OSSPS to avoid problems
when initialising with images that have for instance been reconstructed on a square grid.</li>
<li>B-spline interpolation functions and a few numerical algorithms (IIR and FIR filters, 
1d numerical integration).<br />
</ul>

<h3>Other code changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>ProjDataInfoCylindrical::set_num_views()</code> now  makes sure that we cover the
      same range of angles as before (usually, but not necessarily, 180 degrees).
</li>
<li>Most of the .cxx files in the <tt>recon_buildblock</tt> had to be updated to
add instantiations for parametric images. This is unfortunate and another
mechanism would be nicer.
</li>
<li>moved code that finds subset-num in terms of subiteration-num to 
<code>IterativeReconstruction::get_subset_num()</code>. If you have your own 
reconstruction classes, you should use this member. 
<code>IterativeReconstruction::randomly_permute_subset_order()</code> is now private.</li>
</ul>
