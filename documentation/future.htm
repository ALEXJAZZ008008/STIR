    <h1>Future developments</h1>

The STIR library, in its current state, possesses many
capabilities. The developers, however, look forward to still further
increases in the flexibility and power of the software. Some of the
developments being discussed are:

<ul>
<li> expanded library of polymorphic classes (e.g. image grids, and 
ordered subsets)
<li> additional scanners and modalities: HiDAC, DHCI, SPECT
<li> additional data formats support, without conversion to Interfile.
<li> listmode reconstruction algorithms
</ul>

Below, we list of some of the more concrete features planned for the next
releases. However, which feature is actually finalised/implemented
depends on the needs of the developers. If you want one of these
features and are willing to help, let us know.  

<ul>
<li> More automatic testing programmes 
<li> More algorithms: OSCB (potentially ART, OSMD), FORE coming soon
<li> More projectors 
<li> More priors 
<li>Parallelisation (using PVM or EPX) 
<li> Compatibility of the interpolating backprojector
with SPARC and Opteron processors.
<li> Allow images of arbitrary size in z-direction as well.
<li> Allow x,y offset in images (at least for some projectors)
<li> Automatic segmentation
</ul>
<p>Note that some of these involve updating existing PARAPET 
programs which were written in a (private and incompatible)
earlier release.
</p>
<p>
Finally, as far as coding concerns, the following (big) changes are planned
(but see todo sections in the documentation or the files)</p>
<ul>
<li> Change Reconstruction hierarchy to use objective functions. Also
template them in terms of the input data format
(necessary for listmode reconstructions)
</ul>
