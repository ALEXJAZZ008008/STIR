README file for STIR recon_test_pack version 2.1 (and later versions?)
------------------------------------------------

This test pack runs some simple tests to check if 
OSMAPOSL, correct_projdata, generate_image and stir_math (and optionally some ECAT utilities)
work as expected. This works by checking
their output with output generated by the STIR team itself.

Running the test pack is automatic, but takes a few minutes (depending
on your hardware of course).

Tests are independent of each other, as each test uses the 'good' files
as input.

The file run_*tests.sh are (Bourne) shell scripts that runs all tests 
automatically. run_*tests.bat is the corresponding DOS batch file.
They write some diagnostic output to stdout. Output of
all programs is redirected to log files. In case anything is wrong, these
might contain something useful. If you cannot solve the problems, email to
the user's mailing list (see http://stir.sourceforge.net for info), with all log 
files attached to the email.

Warning:
Any existing files called my_*s or my_*v will be deleted before the actual
tests start. This is because all tests generate such files and we do not
want to have any confusion with files that remained from a previous run.


Run the tests as follows:

On Unix:
--------
(this also work on Windows if you installed CYGWIN)

Testing main STIR utilities:
............................
sh run_tests.sh [ --nointbp ] 
	(if all executables are in your path)

sh run_tests.sh [ --nointbp ] my_install_dir/  
	(if you copied the executables to one directory, 
	 but it isn't in your path)

Use the --nointbp option (case is important) if you want to skip 
reconstructions that use  the interpolating backprojector. You
probably want to do this on Suns (and maybe HP stations ?), as that
backprojector is known to have a problem on those processors
in the centre of the image.

Testing ECAT 6 and 7 utilities
..............................
If you have compiled STIR to use the LNN matrix library for ECAT support.

sh run_ecat_tests.sh 
	(if all executables are in your path)

sh run_ecat_tests.sh my_install_dir/  
	(if you copied the executables to one directory, 
	 but it isn't in your path)



On Windows:
----------
Open a command prompt window
cd to where you extracted the test pack.
type

run_tests [ --nointbp ]
	(if all executables are in your path)

run_tests [ --nointbp ] g:\my_install_dir\  
	(if you copied the executables to one directory (on drive g), 
	 but it isn't in your path)

See above for the --nointbp option.

Similarly, to execute tests for ECAT 6 and 7 routines, do

run_ecat_tests [ install_dir ]
