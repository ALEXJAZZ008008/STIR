This test pack runs some simple tests to check if convecat6_if,
sensitivity and OSMAPOSL work as expected. This works by checking
their output with output generated by the STIR team itself.

Running the test pack is automatic, but takes a few minutes (depending
on your hardware of course).

Tests are independent of each other, as each test uses the 'good' files
as input.

The file run_tests.sh is a (Bourne) shell script that runs all tests 
automatically. run_tests.bat is the corresponding DOS batch file.
Both  write some diagnostic output to stdout. Output of
all programmes is redirected to log files. In case anything is wrong, these
might contain something useful. If you cannot solve the problems, email to
the user's mailing list (see http://stir.irsl.org for info), with all log 
files attached to the email.


Run the tests as follows:

On Unix:
--------
sh run_tests.sh
	(if all executables are in your path)

sh run_tests.sh my_install_dir/  
	(if you copied the executables to one directory, 
	 but it isn't in your path)


On Windows:
----------
Open a command prompt window
cd to where you extracted the test pack.
type

run_tests
	(if all executables are in your path)

run_tests g:\my_install_dir\  
	(if you copied the executables to one directory (on drive g), 
	 but it isn't in your path)
