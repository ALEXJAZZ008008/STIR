Some files are in addition covered by the PARAPET license 
(see PARAPETLICENSE.txt). This is always indicated in the file, but
a complete list is also given at the end of this file.


utilities/cti_utils.cxx is based on work by CTI PET Systems Inc. It
can be redistributed freely, but not used in any commercial program.
Please contact CTI PET systems if you need more information.

SeparableMetzArrayFilter.cxx uses a (modified) fft routine from
Numerical Recipes. If you use this file, you need to comply with 
their license policy (which requires you to buy the book).  
We hope to replace this routine soon.
