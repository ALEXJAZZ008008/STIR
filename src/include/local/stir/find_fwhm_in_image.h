  interpolates a column from the given array, that includes the particular voxel and returns

  It finds the real maximum location, using the 3 points parabolic fit. Then, linear interpolation is used  
  to find the whole line at the given dimension (z:1,y:2,x:3) taking into account the voxels that
  intersects the interpolated voxel which has in its center the point with the real_maximum_value.
  The do_direction is used so that in the direction of the line source will not happen any interpolation
  (Only 3D implementation).

   \ingroup resolution
   \brief Finds FWHM in pixel size units for a number of point sources or a line source   
  
   is the basic function that the utility is based on. It takes the 3D input_image, the number of maxima, 
   the level of the maximum (2 as half maximum, 10 as tenth maximum etc.), the dimension used for line 
   sources and a boolean nema which enables the calculation based on the NEMA Standards Publication 
   NU 2-2001. The implementation calculates and returns in a list container the maximum_value and its 
   location per slice for line sources, sorted by minimum to maximum slice of the using dimension, or per 
   whole image for point sources, sorted by maximum to minimum value. It calculates, as well, the resolution 
   at the same location in the size of units that is used (usually mm). If the dimension is set to 0 it finds 
   the resolution of each one point sources, else it finds the algorithm for the line sources giving its 
   direction (z=1, y=2, x=3), respectively. If given as [num_maxima] less than the total slices it returns 
   the results for some slices by sampling with the same step the total slices of the wanted dimension. 
   (Only 3D implementation). In case it is not needed to be followed to the NEMA standard, for better 
   approximation could be achieved by setting the nema to 0. 
   (In this case the interpolated_line function is used).

   Masks the input_array

  it masks the input_array at the location of a point source setting all values to -1, with a mask size 
  depending on the resolution of the previous point (in pixel units), at each of the directions. In the 
  code there is a scale factor to change easily the size of the mask.
